# Week4: Smart Contract Deployment on Testnet

This repository contains a simple smart contract (`firstcontract.sol`) deployed to an Ethereum test network via Remix.

---

## 📋 Contents

- `firstcontract.sol` — the Solidity contract file.  
- README.md — this file.  

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Basic contract demonstrating [brief description of what the contract does, e.g., storing a value / getter-setter etc.]  
- Deployed to a testnet (e.g., Rinkeby / Goerli / Sepolia / Mumbai etc).  
- Interaction via Remix + MetaMask.  

---

## 🚀 Deployment

1. Open `firstcontract.sol` in Remix IDE.  
2. Compile the contract using a suitable compiler version (specify version if needed).  
3. Connect MetaMask to the testnet you want (e.g., Goerli).  
4. Deploy the contract from Remix on that testnet.  

After deployment, you’ll get a contract address. (You can include that address here if you want.)

## 🔍 Testnet & Address

- **Testnet used:** METAMASK
- **Contract address:** 0x61569e20FA16F45BDDeF4645b997bF2352b1A652

## 📄 How to Use / Interact

- Use Remix / Explorer of testnet (e.g., Etherscan for that testnet) to view contract.  
- Call contract’s functions (if there are getters, setters, etc.).  

---

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure your MetaMask has testnet ETH / tokens for gas.  
- Use the correct Solidity compiler version in Remix.  
- This is for learning purpose / small demo.  

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- Add unit tests.  
- Add more contract functionality.  
- Possibly deploy on mainnet when ready.
